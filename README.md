Social Buzz Analytics
Founded in 2008, Social Buzz is a social media business that emphasis in tracking content interactions from all over the world. Over the past 5 years,
Social Buzz has reached more than 500 millions active users each month generating massive amounts of data.

Social Buzz being a fast growing technology unicorn that need to adapt quickly to it's global scale. Accenture has begun a 3 month POC focusing on these tasks:
*An audit of Social Buzz's big data practice
*Recommendations for a successful IPO
*Analysis to find Social Buzz's top 5 most popular categories of content 

Steps involved in this tasks are:
1.Data Understanding
2.Data Cleaning
3.Data Modelling
4.Data Analysis
5.Uncovering Insights

We tackled this task and found the top 5 most popular categories as asked, but we also went one step further.

- We found that animals and science are the two most popular categories, suggesting that users like "real-life" and "factual" content
- We also found that food was a common theme amongst popular content and the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating brands to promote content.![Dashboard 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113631907/228765969-cd1687d9-5288-42f2-90fa-d76ef4c6761c.png)
